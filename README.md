# S.E.C.R.E.T.S
## Starry-Eyed Cheaters Running Errantly Through Spacetime

I created this platformer and all of it's assets during November 2024 for GitHub's Game Off. It's coded in JavaScript using my one month free trial of the Phaser Editor, and Microsoft Copilot to save me some typing. The UI is html/css for simplicity and accessibility. I created the art with Resprite and an Apple Pen. And I recorded the sounds on my Casio electric piano and edited them with Audacity.

# Theme: Secrets
There's more to this game than meets the eye. Look closely to find all the hidden passage ways, shortcuts, and more!

# Wildcards
I like a challenge, so I've incorporated all three.

### Small Palette (Limit 4 colours or less)
- Black #000000
- Grey #C1C1C1
- Green #07A715
- Purple #A447F8

### Cheat Mode
Find cheat codes in game, or elsewhere, then enter them in the super S.E.C.R.E.T text input to enable them. 

(Hint: you can find all the secrets and collect all the coins without cheating, but the cheats may help you get a better score.)

### Speed Run
Score = Coins Collected - Time

Please share your best score, fastest time, and most coins collected in the comments.

## Controls
KEYBOARD: Everything should work as you expect. WASD or arrow keys to move. (Up or [SPACE] works to jump).
