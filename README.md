# S.E.C.R.E.T.S
## Starry-Eyed Cheaters Running Errantly Through Spacetime

I created this game and all of it's assets during November, for for GitHub's Game Jam 2024. It is coded in JavaScript using my one month free trial of the Phaser Editor, and Microsoft Copilot to save me some typing. The UI is html/css for simplicity and accessibility. I created the art with Resprite and an Apple Pen. And I recorded the sounds on my Casio electric piano and edited them with Blender.

# Theme: Secrets
There's more to this game than first meets the eye. Look and listen closely to find all the hidden passage ways, shortcuts, and more!

## Wildcards
I like a challenge, so I've incorporated all three.

### Small Palette (Limit 4 colours or less)
My colour palette is limited to:
- Black #000000
- Grey #C1C1C1
- Green #07A715
- Purple #A447F8

### Cheat Mode
Find cheat codes in game, or elsewhere, then enter them in the super S.E.C.R.E.T text input to enable them. (Hint: you can find all the secrets and collect all the coins without cheating, but the cheats may help you get a better score.)

### Speed Run
Score = Coins Collected - Time

Please share your best score, fastest time, and most coins collected in the comments :)
