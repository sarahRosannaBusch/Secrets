# S.E.C.R.E.T.S
## Starry-Eyed Cheaters Running Errantly Through Spacetime

I created this game, along with all of it's assets, during November 2024 for for GitHub's Game Jam 2024. It is coded in JavaScript, specifically for web, using Phaser.io. I used Resprite on iOS to create the art, recorded the sounds on my electric piano and edited them with Blender.

### Theme: Secrets
There's more to this game than meets the eye. Keep your eyes peeled to find all the hidden passage ways, shortcuts, and more!

### Wildcards
I like a challenge, so I've incorporated all three.

#### Small Palette (Limit 4 colours or less)
My colour palette is limited to:
- Black #000000
- Grey #C1C1C1
- Green #07A715
- Purple #A447F8

#### Cheat Mode
Find cheat codes in game, or elsewhere, then enter them in the super S.E.C.R.E.T text input to enable them. (Hint: you can find all the secrets and collect all the coins without cheating, but the cheats may help you get a better score.)

#### Speed Run
Score = Coins Collected - Time

Let us know you best score, fastest time, and most coins collected in the comments :)
