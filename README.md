#S.E.C.R.E.T.S
##Starry-Eyed Cheaters Running Errantly Through Spacetime

This game, along with all of it's assets, were created during November 2024 for for GitHub's Game Jam 2024.

###Theme: Secrets
There's more to this game than meets the eye. Keep your eyes peeled to find all the hidden passage ways, shortcuts, and more!

###Wildcards
I like a challenge, so I've incorporated all three.

####Small Palette (Limit 4 colours or less)
My colour palette is limited to:
- Black #000000
- Grey #C1C1C1
- Green #07A715
- Purple #A447F8

####Cheat Mode
Find cheat codes in game, or elsewhere, then enter them in the super S.E.C.R.E.T text input to enable them. (Hint: you can find all the secrets and collect all the coins without cheating, but the cheats may help you get a better score.)

####Speed Run
score = coins collected - time
Let us know you best score, fastest time, and most coins collected in the comments :)
